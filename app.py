                This webtool allows users to plot the genes that are temporally regulated during severe COVID-19 as described in the publication by
                <a href=https://www.thelancet.com/journals/ebiom/article/PIIS2352-3964(21)00055-4/fulltext>Ong et al., eBioMedicine, 2021</a>.<br></br>
                The data plotted is based on 6 severe or moderately severe patients, and daily bloods were taken from day U+2212 -4 to day 13 post respiratory nadir, 
                which is defined by low (<95%) arterial oxygen levels and supplemental oxygen administration (non-invasive ventilation or mechanical ventilation) required.<br><br>
                Day 0 indicates day of respiratory nadir, where peak symptoms were documented. 
                Out of 29,405 genes, 4,831 genes were temporally regulated, as determined by extraction and analysis of differential gene expression (EDGE) (FDR-adjusted p-value < 0.05; q-value < 0.05; Benja-mini-Hochberg step-up procedure).
                
                ## Usage
                Users may query the dataset either by providing a comma-, or newline-separated list of genes or selecting from a dropdown menu in the sidebar.<br></br>
                Genes that were not found will be shown in an expander.<br></br> 
                Myeloid-derived suppressor cell signatures mentioned in Table 1 of [Len et al., Viruses, 2023]() is displayed in a heatmap under the <b>MDSC Heatmap</b> tab for reference.
